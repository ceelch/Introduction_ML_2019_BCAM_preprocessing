# Introduction_ML_2019_BCAM_preprocessing

This short course deals with data preprocessing, which is necessary to perform efficient tasks in Machine Learning.

A typical and widely used example is presented to explain machine learning concepts and examples.

The content included in this short course is a series of slides, which briefly explains the concepts of data preprocessing and also includes a Jupyter Notebook with Python programming where the concepts are implemented.

Any questions, comments or contributions are welcome and do not hesitate to contact me.
